# Eval JavaScript

* Select one or more lines of JavaScript with your cursor
* `cmd-i` runs it in the console

This package shamelessly forked from [robenkleene](https://github.com/robenkleene/run-in-atom)'s [run-in-atom](https://atom.io/packages/run-in-atom), with the following differentiating features:

* Cleaner console.log's
* Can evaluate JS in &lt;script&gt; tags
* Probably broke a bunch of stuff
